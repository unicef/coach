    req9:

        context: ["yes"]
        evidence: "The Oky app has been designed with very high privacy settings, to protect users. We do not hold in our database any personally identifiable data. While user-generated fields at time of registration (username, password, secure answer) are not able to identify an individual, as part of Okyâ€™s strict data governance approach, Oky hashes and salts these fields to render the original values inaccessible. This hashing approach is used with the purpose to: (a) obfuscate the username to anyone who might access the database, and (b) to guarantee user authentication, ie. to allow users to log into their account on the same device or a different device."
