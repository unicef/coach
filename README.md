## :information_source: What is Coach?

Coach is short for UNICEF Coach Cards.
Coach Cards are at-a-glance report cards in a software or technology project's advancements towards achieving the [Digital Public Good Standard][1].
They are used in the context of measuring the progress of [UNICEF Venture Fund][2] portfolio companies in meeting the DPG Standard.

The report card shows change over time and monitors progress towards becoming a certified DPG.
We will build a visual dashboard, using a mix of automatic and manually curated data, to offer an assessment or score of the quality of the Open Source work.
The report card assessments are publicly visible reports that the DPG candidate can use in their Open Source outreach and marketing strategies.
